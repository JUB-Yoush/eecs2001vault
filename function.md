#notation 
- a funciton is an input and output relationship
- also considered mappings, as $f(a)=b$ can be considered "a maps to b"
- the same input always makes the same output


### relation
- take the classic GDYU birthday game rock paper scissors

| beats    | scissors | paper | rock |
| -------- | -------- | ----- | ---- |
| scissors | f        | t     | f    |
| paper    | f        | f     | t    |
| rock     | t        | f     | f     |

- the game can be expressed as a [[function-k-ary|binary function]] f(A,B), where A is the one we're playing and B is the one our opponent is playing
- the functino will return if we won or not

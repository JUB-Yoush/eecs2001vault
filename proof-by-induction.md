- proofs using time paradoxes?
- the general concept is that you're proving a theorem (let's call if function P()) for every value in an infinite set
- but you can't prove conclusivley unless you show it applies for every value, which is hard considering it's not finite.
- so instead, make it solve itself recursivley.
- if you can prove it works for the first value, and then prove it works for any value n+1 (the value after any arbitrary value), then you've proved it works for everything!

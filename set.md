#notation
#todo 
- unoredered group of objects represented as a unit, they can contain numbers, words, or any kind of abstract element
- the order and repition do not matter
- S = {7,21,57} is a set containing 7,21 and 57
- the symbols $\in$ and $\not \in$ represent an element existing or not existing in a set
	- 7 $\in$ S is true 
	- 57 $\not \in$ set is false

### multiset
- sets usually ignore duplicates, however you can take the number of occurances of members into account by using a multiset instead of a set
- the set {7} and {7,7} are the same set but different multisets

### infinite sets
- we can have sets that have infinte amounts of values by figuring out what kind of values should be in the set
	- a set of all the natural numbers 
	- a set of all intergers
	- a set of all the intergers multiplied by 3
- we can't write these sets out, so we represent them with ... in place of where the rest of the values would go 
	- {1,2,3,...}
	- {... -2,-1,0,1,2...}
	- {-6,-3,0,3,6}
- some common infinte sets have letters associated to represent them, you can find a list of them [here](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/symbols/Set_Symbols.html)

### subsets
- Set A is a subset of Set B if every member of A is also a member of B
- this is represented by the $\subseteq$ symbol
- it could also be a proper subset, which means A is not equal to B (A is not a subset of B because they're the same set), represented by the $\subset$


### intersection
- an operation that returns the values that two sets share

### union
- an operation that joins the values of two sets together

	- 7 $\in$ S is true 
	- 57 $\not \in$ set is false

### subsets
- Set A is a subset of Set B if every member of A is also a member of B
- this is represented by the $\subseteq$ symbol
- it could also be a proper subset, which means A is not equal to B (A is not a subset of B because they're the same set), represented by the $\subset$

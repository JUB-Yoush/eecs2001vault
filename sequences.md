#notation 
#todo 
- a sequence is a ordered list of objects
- the values in the tuple are written in parentheses.
- (7,21,57) is a tuple
- unlike sets, duplicates and ordering matters
### tuple
- a finite sequence
- A sequence of k elements is called a **k-tuple**
- so (7,21,57) is a 3-tuple
- a 2-tuple is called an **ordered-pair**
### cross-product
- if A and B are two sets then the Cartesican product or cross-product of A and B (written as A$\times$B) is the set of all ordered pairs wherein the first element is a member of A and the second element is a member of B.
- imagine making a grid and the x axis was A and the y axis was B
	- if A = {1,2} and B = {x,y,z}
	- $A \times B$ = { (1, x), (1, y), (1, z), (2, x), (2, y), (2, z) }
	
### power-set
- the power set of A is the set of all subsets of A. If A is the set {0,1}, the pwoer if set of A is {0,1} the power set of A is a set of every subset of a, so it would be {{$\emptyset$},{0},{1},{0,1}}

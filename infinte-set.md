 #notation 
- we can have [[set|sets]] that have infinte amounts of values by figuring out what kind of values should be in the set
	- a set of all the natural numbers 
	- a set of all intergers
	- a set of all the intergers multiplied by 3
- we can't write these sets out, so we represent them with ... in place of where the rest of the values would go 
	- {1,2,3,...}
	- {... -2,-1,0,1,2...}
	- {-6,-3,0,3,6}
- some common infinte sets have letters associated to represent them, you can find a list of them [here](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/symbols/Set_Symbols.html)

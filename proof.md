Tips for writing proofs:
- be patient: it takes time and deep consideration
- come back to questions you've been stumped on
- be neat: well structured steps are easier to follow and expand off of
- be concise: short and intutive proofs are better than long and winding ones
- try to find commonalities between members of a set: if K>0, try K=1, K=2 and so on to find a pattern
- use a counter example to disprove a proof, or prove one (make a counter example for the opposite proof)

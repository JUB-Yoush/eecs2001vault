#notation 
- a funciton is an input and output relationship
- also considered mappings, as $f(a)=b$ can be considered "a maps to b"
- the same input always makes the same output
### domain-range
- the [[set-and-sequence#set|set]] of all possible inputs and outputs respectivley.
- the notation for saying "f is a function with domain D and range R is": $f:D \rightarrow R$

### k-ary functions
- a funtion can take in more than one argument
- A function with k arguments is considered a k-ary function
- 1 argument is a **unary** function and 2 is a **binary** function

### infix notation
- used for some common binary functions, like simple math operations 
- we don't write add(a,b), we use a + b
- if it's written with add(a,b) then it's prefix notation

### prefix notation

### predicate-or-property
- a function who's range is {TRUE,FALSE}

- a series of statements that prove a [[proof]] directly
- also known as a proof-by-constructionu

### example:
- Prove the theorem: for each even number n greater than 2, there exists a [[k-regular-graph|3 regular graph]] with n nodes
- represent the graph as a set 
- n is a even number greater than 2, G(V,E) // (Vertices and Edges)
- V = {0,1,...,n-1} // number of nodes in the graph
- E =

- if A and B are two [[set|sets]] then the Cartesican product or cross-product of A and B (written as A$\times$B) is the set of all ordered pairs wherein the first element is a member of A and the second element is a member of B.
- imagine making a grid and the x axis was A and the y axis was B
	- if A = {1,2} and B = {x,y,z}
	- $A \times B$ = { (1, x), (1, y), (1, z), (2, x), (2, y), (2, z) }
